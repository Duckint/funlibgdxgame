# funlibgdxgame
A 2D platformer I'm working on to help me better understand Java and LibGDX.


--How To Build--

So, you wanna know how to build this fun little project? That's great!

However, how you build this project depends on the IDE being used. 

**IntelliJ**(recommended IDE): 
- Download and Install [IntelliJ Community Edition or Ultimate Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
- Download and Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) OR download the .zip of this repository directly(recommended way).
- Download and Install [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/).
- If you downloaded Github Desktop, you'll need to go to the top of the main page of this repository, click the green **"Code"** drop down button and click "Open with     Github Desktop". 
  It will open GitHub Desktop and ask you where you want the repository cloned to on your computer. Put it in a safe spot where you won't lose or delete it. 
  (In Windows 10/11, you find your cloned repositories in Documents by default, in the GitHub folder.) 
- If you downloaded the .zip, unzip the file to a safe place on your drive.
- Open IntelliJ and click Open File/Project and open the cloned/unzipped repository.
- In the bottom right of the window as the project is opening, it will ask you to install any missing things required to build it. Click install for all of those.
- Once the project is finished loading and you have installed everything needed, click View, then hover over toolbars and click Gradle. 
- You should now a sidebar on the right with a lot of Gradle options. Scroll down to desktop, drop it down to tasks, drop down "Other", and double click "run".

If everything works as intended, you should see a window pop-up with my WIP code. **Congratulations, you built funlibgdxgame!**
From now on in that specific project, if you click the green play button at the top, it should automatically run and save you the hassle of running through the sidebar.
I will update this with clearer instructions and more IDEs over time, but for now it's just IntelliJ.

If you have any suggestions or modifications for my code, feel free to contribute!
